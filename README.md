#Photo&Go Focus API

We're currently transitioning from [API v1](v1) to [API v2](v2).
Each version lives on separate folder in this repository. You can find documentation on each directory.

The [client facing app](http://github.com/photoandgo//focus-front-end)  connects to v1 and [admin](http://github.com/photoandgo//focus-admin)
